This code book explains the data found in tidyallmeandata.txt. Before jumping into the information on data, a brief explanation on what qualifies tidyallmeandata.txt as the tidy data is provided below:  

<b> Why is this tidy data?</b>  
The basic requirements of tidy data are shown below. Requirements met by tidyallmeandata.txt have been highlighted in <b>bold</b>. When requirements are not met, a note has been added explaining the reason for non-compliance.  
1) <b>Each variable you measure should be in one column. </b>    
2) <b>Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row.</b>  
3) There should be one table for each "kind" of variable:- This has not been done to minimize the need for loading different tables when using the different variables in subsequent data manipulation tasks.   
4) If you have multiple tables, they should include a column in the table that allows them to be linked:- Not applicable since there is only one table.  
5) <b>Include a row at the top of each file with variable names.</b>  
6) <b>Make variable names human readable AgeAtDiagnosis instead of AgeDx</b>  
7)<b> In general data should be saved in one file per table.</b>
