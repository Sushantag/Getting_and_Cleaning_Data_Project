<b>Code Book for tidyallmeandata.txt</b>  


<b>Introduction</b>
This code book explains the data found in tidyallmeandata.txt. Before jumping into the information on data, a brief explanation on what qualifies tidyallmeandata.txt as the tidy data is provided below:  

<b> Why is this tidy data?</b>  
The basic requirements of tidy data are shown below. Requirements met by tidyallmeandata.txt (dataset) have been highlighted in <b>bold</b>. When requirements are not met, a note has been added explaining the reason for non-compliance. The data set meets 5 out of 7 requirements and hence qualifies as a tidy data set.  
1) <b>Each variable you measure should be in one column. </b>    
2) <b>Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row.</b>  
3) There should be one table for each "kind" of variable:- This has not been done to minimize the need for loading different tables when using the different variables in subsequent data manipulation tasks.   
4) If you have multiple tables, they should include a column in the table that allows them to be linked:- Not applicable since there is only one table.  
5) <b>Include a row at the top of each file with variable names.</b>  
6) <b>Make variable names human readable AgeAtDiagnosis instead of AgeDx</b>  
7)<b> In general data should be saved in one file per table.</b>  

<b>Study Design</b>  

The data for this study was obtained from a study done in 2012 by [1] with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

<b>Code Book</b>  


subject:  An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. Since there were 30 volunteers in the study.  This variable varies between 1 to 30.  


activity: This variable indicates the activity being performed by the subject at the time of measurement.  This variable takes one of the following values: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.  


The following variables are the arithematic means calculated from all the meeasurments obtained from the study discussed in Study Design. Of all the variables from the study, only those variables which denote mean and standard deviation have been processed in this data set (this was one of the requirements of the assignment).
